# excel-sheet-concatenator
This script reads an Excel file with multiple sheets, combines all sheets into a single DataFrame, and then writes this data to a new Excel file with adjusted column widths to accommodate the data. Excel often takes a long time to do this using its inbuilt function, this does it in exponentially less time.
